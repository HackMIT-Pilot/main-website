			h5 What is a hackathon?
			span A hackathon is a combination between a computer programming workshop and art show. It is an event where people come together and collaborate to build them. Entrepreneurs, designers, and developers work in teams to create hacks and apps for web or mobile platforms - in our case, these creators are high school students.
			h5 Who can participate?
			span Blueprint is open to all high school students! Coding experience is not required. You aren't required to have ever attended a hackathon before: we will have tech talks beforehand so you can ramp up quickly. You can come with a team or come alone - there will be a place for you.
			h5 Do I need a team? Will I be able to find a team? Can I do it alone?
			span Nope! We will have sessions to help people find team members and/or form teams, as well as an idea generation workshop to help people think of ideas to work on for the hackathon. So you should sign up regardless!
			h5 Do I have to be there the entire time?
			span Yes

			h5 Will there be food?
			span There will be a lot of great food! We'll make sure you are fed well so you can focus on learning and inspiring.
			h5 How does judging work?
			span We are working out the exact details, but teams will demo their projects to the judges Sunday afternoon. Our panel of judges will rate your app based on creativity, technical difficulty, polish, and usefulness.
