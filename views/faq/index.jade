			h5 What is a hackathon?
			span A hackathon is a fun collaborative development session where people work together to build cool ideas. Entrepreneurs, designers, and developers work in teams to create cool apps or prototypes for web or mobile platforms.<br><br>But Blueprint is not just a hackathon.

			h5 So how is Blueprint different?
			span Blueprint is a Pilot event, a sort of combination of a hackathon and a 12-hour workshop focused on creativity, collaboration, and learning by doing. Our event is for high school students of all skill levels—it’s totally fine if you’ve never programmed before! All you need is interest and creativity; our team of world-class mentors will help you learn the rest. You’ll get to meet mentors from a variety of innovative companies, as well as talk to entrepreneurs involved in the startup scene.<br>If you are more experienced, you’ll be able to focus on building your idea with your team, and consult with our expert mentors as needed.

			h5 Who can participate?
			span Blueprint is open to all high school students! Coding experience is not required. You aren't required to have ever attended a hackathon before: we will have presentations and mentors so you can ramp up quickly. You can come with a team or come alone - there will be a place for you.
