				h4 Blueprint Important Safety Policies and Media Release
				p Revision 1; revised Dec 26, 2013

				p TechX HackMIT (an MIT student organization) presents Blueprint, a 12-hour Pilot event where high school students work together in teams to design, build, and pitch their own apps and websites. Blueprint aims provide a <strong>safe and welcoming environment for all students</strong> and their creative ideas. We need to ensure we can maintain a positive atmosphere so you can focus on learning and inspiring others.

				p In the following policies, “I” and “you” is defined as the high school student attendee registering this application. “Your parent/guardian” refers to the parent or legal guardian of the high school student attendee. <strong>By clicking "Submit" below, you and your parent/guardian agree to the following</strong>:

				ul
					li I will <strong>not bring weapons of any kind to Blueprint</strong>. Firearms, knives, and other weapons are banned. If you can't bring it on an airplane, don't bring it here!
					li I will <strong>not bring anything illegal</strong> to Blueprint.
					li I will conduct myself in a manner respectful to others. If I don’t, I understand I may be asked to leave before the event is finished.
					li If I borrow a laptop from Blueprint, I will never leave it unattended, and will return it in good condition.
					li I hereby <strong>grant permission to Blueprint and its staff to photograph or record my image, likeness, or depiction</strong> for use in promotional and press materials.
					li I agree that if I am under age 18, I have reviewed this document with my parent/guardian and they agree to the conditions herein on my behalf.

				//
					p In summary, don’t bring any weapons or anything illegal. Be respectful to yourself, other attendees, and event staff. If we lend you a laptop, we expect it will be returned in the condition it was lended out to you. You give us the right to use your picture in our marketing materials. Also, if you are a minor, make sure you parent or guardian has given you permission to attend.

				p With that out of the way, we know you’ll have a fantastic time at Blueprint! We can’t wait!
